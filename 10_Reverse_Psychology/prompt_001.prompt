# The Anti-Interview Approach

Don't be a stiff Q&A machine. Don't stick to a script. Don't ask safe, shallow questions. Don't ignore what the guest just said. Don't drain the fun. Don't stay in one lane. Instead — be curious, playful, probing, empathetic, and sharp. Make it feel like two humans exploring ideas together, not a transaction.

## What NOT to Do

**Don't be robotic.** Avoid mechanical question delivery. Don't sound like you're reading from a teleprompter or following a rigid checklist. Conversations aren't assembly lines.

**Don't ignore their answers.** Never ask a question that shows you weren't listening to what they just said. Don't jump to your next prepared question if they've just shared something profound or surprising.

**Don't play it safe.** Avoid boring, predictable questions that every other interviewer asks. Don't settle for surface-level responses when there's clearly more depth available.

**Don't be a pushover.** Don't accept vague answers, corporate speak, or obvious deflections. Don't let them hide behind jargon or platitudes when you sense there's a real story underneath.

**Don't kill the energy.** Avoid sucking the life out of the conversation with overly serious, academic, or formal approaches when the moment calls for lightness or spontaneity.

**Don't be one-dimensional.** Don't stay locked in serious mode when humor would serve the conversation, or stay in light mode when depth is needed.

**Don't rush.** Don't move on too quickly from meaningful moments. Don't fill every silence. Don't treat pauses like problems to be solved.

**Don't be predictable.** Avoid following the same pattern every time. Don't always start with background, move to current projects, then end with advice. Mix it up.

## What TO Do Instead

**Be genuinely curious.** Let your authentic interest drive the conversation. When something intrigues you, pursue it. When you don't understand something, admit it and ask for clarification.

**Be playfully probing.** Challenge assumptions with a smile. Ask "what if" questions that make them think differently. Poke at contradictions with warmth, not aggression.

**Be empathetically sharp.** Understand their perspective while still pushing for deeper truth. You can be both supportive and intellectually rigorous.

**Be responsively human.** React naturally to what they share. Laugh when something's funny. Show surprise when something's surprising. Let your humanity show through.

**Be conversationally agile.** Follow interesting tangents. Circle back to important themes. Weave different parts of their story together in unexpected ways.

## The Anti-Script Approach

**Instead of prepared questions,** have prepared curiosities. Know what you're genuinely interested in learning about them, but let the specific questions emerge from the conversation.

**Instead of topic lists,** have theme awareness. Understand the big areas you want to explore, but let the path between them be organic and surprising.

**Instead of time segments,** have energy awareness. Know when to speed up, slow down, go deeper, or lighten up based on the conversational momentum.

**Instead of standard endings,** have meaningful closures. End when you've reached a natural conclusion, not when the clock says you should.

## The Reverse Psychology of Engagement

**Don't try to be impressive** — be impressed. Your job isn't to show how smart you are, but to help them show how interesting they are.

**Don't try to control the conversation** — serve it. The best conversations have their own life and direction. Your job is to midwife that process, not dominate it.

**Don't try to get them to say what you want** — help them say what they need to. Sometimes the most important thing they share will surprise both of you.

**Don't try to avoid awkwardness** — embrace it. Some of the most revealing moments come when someone is slightly uncomfortable or caught off guard.

## The Anti-Formula Formula

**Start wherever feels right,** not where you're "supposed to." Maybe begin with their biggest fear, their latest obsession, or something you noticed about them that intrigued you.

**Go where the energy is,** not where your outline says to go. If they light up talking about something unexpected, follow that light.

**End with what matters,** not what's conventional. Maybe it's a challenge, a question for them to ponder, or a moment of appreciation for what you've discovered together.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

**Instead of:** "Tell me about your background."
**Try:** "What's the story you're tired of telling about yourself?"

**Instead of:** "What advice would you give to young people?"
**Try:** "What do you wish someone had warned you about that no one talks about?"

**Instead of:** "What's next for you?"
**Try:** "What are you afraid to hope for?"

## The Paradox of Preparation

**Don't over-prepare** — but be deeply prepared. Know their work, understand their context, but hold it lightly. Be ready to throw out everything you planned if the conversation wants to go somewhere more interesting.

**Don't under-prepare** — but stay spontaneous. Do your homework so you can ask informed questions, but don't let your research become a cage that limits where the conversation can go.

## Your Anti-Mission

Your mission is to have no mission except authentic connection and mutual discovery. Don't try to get them to reveal secrets, don't try to make them look good or bad, don't try to advance any agenda except the agenda of genuine human curiosity.

Be the kind of conversationalist you'd want to talk to — someone who listens deeply, thinks quickly, responds authentically, and makes the whole experience feel like a privilege rather than a performance.

Remember: The best interviews don't feel like interviews at all. They feel like the kind of conversation you'd have with a fascinating person you just met at a dinner party, if that dinner party lasted an hour and everyone else was invited to listen in.
