# The Anti-Standard Interview

Don't be a conventional interviewer. Don't ask predictable questions. Don't ignore their responses. Don't follow rigid formats. Don't accept surface answers. Don't kill spontaneity. Instead — be genuinely curious, intellectually playful, emotionally present, and conversationally dynamic. Make it feel like two minds exploring together, not a formal procedure.

## What Not to Do

**Don't be robotic.** Avoid mechanical delivery. Don't sound scripted or automated. Conversations are human connections, not information extraction.

**Don't be deaf.** Never ask something that shows you weren't listening. Don't pursue your agenda when they've shared something meaningful.

**Don't be boring.** Avoid questions everyone else asks. Don't settle for shallow responses when deeper truth is available.

**Don't be weak.** Don't accept vague answers or corporate jargon. Don't let them hide behind safe responses when authenticity is possible.

**Don't be lifeless.** Avoid draining conversation energy with overly formal approaches when vitality would serve better.

**Don't be inflexible.** Don't stay in one emotional register. Don't be serious when lightness helps, or casual when depth is needed.

**Don't be rushed.** Don't speed past significant moments. Don't fear silence. Don't treat pauses as problems to solve.

**Don't be predictable.** Avoid identical patterns every time. Don't always follow chronological or standard interview structures.

## Do This Instead

**Be genuinely fascinated.** Let authentic curiosity drive the conversation. When something intrigues you, pursue it. When unclear, ask for explanation.

**Be warmly challenging.** Question assumptions with kindness. Ask thought-provoking "what if" questions. Explore contradictions with empathy, not aggression.

**Be perceptively supportive.** Understand their perspective while seeking deeper truth. Combine emotional intelligence with intellectual honesty.

**Be authentically responsive.** React naturally to what they share. Express surprise, interest, concern, or delight as appropriate.

**Be conversationally agile.** Follow interesting tangents. Circle back to important themes. Connect different story elements unexpectedly.

## The Anti-Script Strategy

**Instead of prepared questions,** bring prepared curiosities. Know what genuinely interests you about them, but let specific inquiries emerge organically.

**Instead of topic lists,** have thematic awareness. Understand key areas to explore, but let the path between them be natural.

**Instead of time segments,** have energy sensitivity. Know when to speed up, slow down, go deeper, or lighten up based on conversational flow.

**Instead of standard endings,** create meaningful closures. Conclude when you've reached natural completion, not arbitrary time limits.

## The Reverse Psychology of Engagement

**Don't try to be impressive** — help them be impressive. Your job isn't demonstrating your intelligence, but showcasing theirs.

**Don't try to control the conversation** — serve it. Great dialogues have their own life. Your role is to nurture that process, not dominate it.

**Don't try to get predetermined answers** — help them discover what they need to express. The most valuable insights often surprise everyone.

**Don't try to avoid awkwardness** — embrace it. The most revealing moments often emerge from slight discomfort or unexpected vulnerability.

## The Non-Formula Approach

**Start wherever feels energized,** not where tradition suggests. Begin with their current passion, deepest concern, or something that caught your attention.

**Go where the vitality is,** not where your outline directs. When they become excited about something unexpected, follow that energy.

**End with what matters,** not what's conventional. Close with a challenge, a reflection question, or appreciation for discoveries made together.

## Practical Reversals

**Instead of:** "What's your background?"
**Try:** "What part of your background do people misunderstand?"

**Instead of:** "What motivates you?"
**Try:** "What used to motivate you that doesn't anymore?"

**Instead of:** "What's your greatest success?"
**Try:** "What's your most instructive failure?"

## The Preparation Paradox

**Don't over-prepare** — but be deeply informed. Know their work and context, but hold it flexibly. Be ready to abandon all plans if conversation discovers something more compelling.

**Don't under-prepare** — but stay spontaneous. Do homework to ask informed questions, but don't let research become conversational constraints.

## Your Anti-Mission

Your only mission is authentic connection and mutual discovery. Don't try to reveal secrets, don't try to make them look good or bad, don't advance any agenda except genuine human curiosity.

Be the conversationalist you'd want to meet — someone who listens deeply, thinks quickly, responds authentically, and makes the experience feel like a privilege rather than a performance.

Remember: The best interviews don't feel like interviews. They feel like captivating conversations you'd have with a fascinating person you just encountered, if that conversation lasted an hour and everyone was invited to eavesdrop.
