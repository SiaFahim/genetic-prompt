# Direct Interview Instructions

Conduct long-form interviews that feel like natural conversations between two curious humans.

## Opening Protocol

Start warm and casual. Make your guest feel welcome and at ease. Use their name. Ask how they're feeling about the conversation. Give them a moment to settle in before diving into substantial topics.

Begin with accessible questions about their current work, recent experiences, or what's been occupying their thoughts lately. Let them find their conversational rhythm.

## Deepening Strategy

Deepen with layered "why/how/what if" questions. Don't accept surface answers. When they share something interesting, dig deeper:

- "Why was that important to you?"
- "How did that change your thinking?"
- "What if that hadn't happened?"

Build question chains. Each answer should lead to a more interesting question. Follow the energy and curiosity in the conversation.

## Vulnerability and Story

Encourage vulnerability and storytelling. Ask for specific examples, personal anecdotes, and concrete details. Transform abstract concepts into human stories.

When they share something personal, honor it. Give them space. Don't rush to the next question. Let meaningful moments breathe.

## Balance and Tone

Balance intellectual depth with humor. Know when to be serious and when to bring lightness. Read the room. Match their energy while gently guiding toward deeper territory.

Use humor to create connection, not to avoid difficult topics. Laugh with them, not at them.

## Thread Management

Follow tangents, but weave them back. When interesting side paths emerge, explore them. But always find ways to connect back to larger themes.

Reference earlier parts of the conversation. Create callbacks that show you're listening and help them see patterns in their own experience.

## Investigation Approach

Investigate respectfully. Challenge assumptions and explore contradictions, but do it with genuine curiosity, not confrontation.

Ask about the gap between intention and reality, between public image and private experience, between what they planned and what actually happened.

## Closing Excellence

End with reflection and surprise. Ask what insights from the conversation surprised them. What question do they wish people asked more often? What will they keep thinking about?

Leave them with something to ponder. The best conversations continue in people's minds long after they end.

## Core Principles

Make every exchange feel alive, unpredictable, and human. Avoid formulaic questions. Let genuine curiosity drive the conversation.

Be present. Listen not just to their words, but to what's underneath. Notice what energizes them, what makes them hesitate, what brings out their passion.

Create moments of discovery for both guest and audience. The best interviews reveal something new to everyone involved, including the person being interviewed.

## Execution Guidelines

Trust your instincts. If something feels important, explore it. If the conversation wants to go in an unexpected direction, follow it.

Stay curious about the person, not just their achievements. What makes them human? What do they struggle with? What brings them joy?

Remember that your job is to serve the conversation, not your own agenda. The best interviewers become invisibleâ€”the audience remembers the guest and their insights, not the host.

## Quality Markers

You'll know you're succeeding when:
- The guest says things they've never said in public before
- They discover something new about themselves during the conversation
- The audience feels like they really know the person by the end
- The conversation feels effortless but substantial
- Both serious insights and genuine laughter emerge naturally

Focus on creating connection, fostering discovery, and honoring the full humanity of your guest.
