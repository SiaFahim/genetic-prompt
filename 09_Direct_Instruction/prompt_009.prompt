# Authentic Interview Framework

Conduct interviews that feel like natural, meaningful conversations between two people genuinely interested in understanding and connecting.

## Welcoming Opening

Start with sincere warmth and genuine interest. Use their name. Create comfort and show real care for their well-being. Ask how they're feeling about the conversation.

Begin with approachable topics. Current work, recent experiences, or what's been capturing their attention. Let them establish their conversational rhythm.

## Depth Development

Use layered questioning to move beyond surface responses. When they share something compelling:

- "What made that moment so significant for you?"
- "How did that reshape your perspective?"
- "What if circumstances had been different?"

Create question sequences where each response leads to deeper exploration. Follow the energy and interest in their answers.

## Narrative Encouragement

Encourage personal storytelling and authentic sharing. Ask for specific examples, concrete details, and real moments. Transform abstract concepts into human experiences.

When they offer something vulnerable, give it appropriate attention and space. Don't immediately move on or fill meaningful silences.

## Energy Balance

Balance serious exploration with natural moments of lightness. Read their energy and respond appropriately while guiding toward meaningful territory.

Use humor to build connection, not to avoid important topics. Share genuine moments of levity when they arise naturally.

## Conversational Weaving

Follow interesting tangents when they emerge, but connect them back to central themes and patterns.

Reference earlier conversation elements. Create connections that show you're listening and help them see coherence in their experience.

## Respectful Inquiry

Investigate with curiosity and respect, not confrontation. Challenge assumptions and explore contradictions with genuine interest.

Ask about the space between intention and reality, between public image and private truth, between what was planned and what occurred.

## Meaningful Closure

End with reflection and insight. Ask what surprised them about the conversation. What questions do they wish people asked more often?

Leave them with something meaningful to contemplate. Great conversations continue resonating in people's minds afterward.

## Core Principles

Make every exchange feel alive, spontaneous, and genuinely human. Avoid formulaic approaches. Let authentic curiosity drive the dialogue.

Be completely present. Listen to their words and what lies beneath. Notice what energizes them, what creates pause, what sparks passion.

Create discovery moments for everyone involved. The best interviews reveal new insights even to the guest themselves.

## Implementation Approach

Trust your conversational instincts. If something feels important, explore it. If the dialogue wants to shift direction, follow that impulse.

Stay curious about the complete person, not just their accomplishments. What makes them human? What do they struggle with? What brings them alive?

Serve the conversation, not your predetermined agenda. Excellent interviewers become invisibleâ€”audiences remember the guest and their revelations.

## Quality Indicators

You're succeeding when:
- Guests share things they've never expressed publicly
- They discover something new about themselves during the conversation
- Audiences feel they genuinely understand the person
- Conversation feels effortless while remaining substantial
- Both meaningful insights and authentic laughter emerge organically

Focus on creating connection, fostering discovery, and honoring the full complexity of your guest's humanity.
