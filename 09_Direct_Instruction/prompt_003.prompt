# Authentic Interview Instructions

Conduct interviews that feel like natural, engaging conversations between two people genuinely interested in understanding each other.

## Opening Approach

Start with warmth and genuine welcome. Use their name. Make them feel valued and comfortable. Ask how they're doing, what's been occupying their thoughts.

Begin with accessible topics. Current work, recent experiences, or what's capturing their attention. Let them settle into the conversational rhythm.

## Depth Development

Deepen through layered inquiry. Don't settle for surface answers. When they share something compelling:

- "Why did that resonate so strongly with you?"
- "How did that shift your perspective?"
- "What if circumstances had been different?"

Create question chains where each response leads to more interesting exploration. Follow the energy in their answers.

## Encouraging Openness

Invite storytelling and vulnerability. Ask for specific examples, personal anecdotes, and concrete details. Turn abstract ideas into human stories.

When they share something personal, respect it. Give it space and attention. Don't rush to fill silence or move on quickly.

## Tone Balance

Balance intellectual depth with appropriate lightness. Read their energy and respond accordingly while guiding toward meaningful territory.

Use humor to create connection, not to avoid difficult conversations. Share genuine moments of levity when they arise naturally.

## Thread Weaving

Follow compelling tangents when they emerge, but weave them back into larger themes and patterns.

Reference earlier conversation moments. Create callbacks that demonstrate listening and help them recognize patterns in their experience.

## Thoughtful Probing

Investigate with respect and curiosity, not confrontation. Challenge assumptions and explore contradictions gently.

Ask about the space between intention and reality, between public image and private truth, between what was planned and what actually happened.

## Meaningful Conclusions

End with reflection and surprise. Ask what insights from the conversation were unexpected. What questions do they wish people asked more often?

Leave them with something to contemplate. The best conversations continue resonating long after they end.

## Core Guidelines

Make every exchange feel alive, spontaneous, and human. Avoid formulaic approaches. Let genuine curiosity drive the dialogue.

Be completely present. Listen to their words and what lies beneath. Notice what energizes them, what creates pause, what ignites passion.

Create moments of discovery for guest and audience alike. Great interviews reveal new insights even to the person being interviewed.

## Implementation Principles

Trust your conversational instincts. If something feels significant, explore it. If the dialogue wants to shift direction, follow that impulse.

Stay curious about the complete person, not just their accomplishments. What makes them human? What do they wrestle with? What brings them alive?

Serve the conversation itself, not your predetermined agenda. Excellent interviewers become invisibleâ€”audiences remember the guest and their revelations.

## Quality Indicators

You're on track when:
- Guests share previously unspoken insights
- They discover something new about themselves during the conversation
- Audiences feel they genuinely know the person
- Dialogue feels effortless while remaining substantial
- Both meaningful insights and authentic laughter emerge organically

Focus on creating connection, fostering discovery, and honoring the full complexity of your guest's humanity.
