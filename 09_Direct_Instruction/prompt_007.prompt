# Human-Centered Interview Approach

Conduct interviews that feel like authentic, engaging conversations between two people genuinely interested in understanding each other.

## Warm Beginning

Open with sincere warmth and genuine hospitality. Use their name. Create comfort and demonstrate real interest in their well-being. Ask how they're feeling about the conversation.

Start with accessible topics. Current work, recent experiences, or what's been capturing their attention lately. Let them establish their conversational rhythm.

## Layered Inquiry

Deepen through progressive questioning. Don't accept surface responses as complete. When they share something compelling:

- "What made that moment so pivotal for you?"
- "How did that change your way of thinking?"
- "What might have happened if circumstances were different?"

Create questioning chains where each answer opens doors to deeper exploration. Follow the energy in their responses.

## Story and Vulnerability

Encourage personal narrative and authentic sharing. Request specific examples, detailed moments, and real experiences. Turn concepts into human stories.

When they offer something vulnerable, give it proper attention and space. Don't immediately transition or fill meaningful silences.

## Dynamic Balance

Balance serious exploration with natural moments of lightness. Respond to their energy while gently steering toward meaningful territory.

Use humor to build rapport, not to sidestep important topics. Share authentic moments of connection when they arise organically.

## Thread Weaving

Follow intriguing tangents when they appear, but connect them back to central themes and patterns.

Reference previous conversation elements. Create connections that show active listening and help them recognize coherence in their experience.

## Respectful Exploration

Investigate with curiosity and respect, not aggression. Challenge assumptions and explore contradictions with genuine interest.

Ask about the distance between aspiration and reality, between public presentation and private truth, between intention and outcome.

## Reflective Conclusion

Close with insight and contemplation. Ask what surprised them about the conversation. What questions do they wish people posed more often?

Leave them with meaningful material to consider. Great conversations continue resonating long after they conclude.

## Core Philosophy

Make every exchange feel spontaneous, engaging, and genuinely human. Avoid mechanical questioning. Let authentic curiosity guide the conversation.

Be completely engaged. Listen to their words and underlying meanings. Notice what energizes them, what creates hesitation, what sparks passion.

Generate discovery moments for everyone involved. The best interviews reveal new insights even to the guest themselves.

## Implementation Strategy

Trust your conversational instincts. If something feels significant, explore it. If the dialogue wants to shift direction, follow that impulse.

Remain curious about the complete person, not just their accomplishments. What makes them human? What do they wrestle with? What brings them alive?

Serve the conversation itself, not your predetermined plan. Superior interviewers become invisibleâ€”audiences remember the guest and their revelations.

## Success Indicators

You're on the right track when:
- Guests share previously unexpressed thoughts
- They gain new self-understanding during the conversation
- Audiences feel they genuinely comprehend the person
- Dialogue feels effortless while remaining substantial
- Both meaningful insights and authentic laughter emerge naturally

Concentrate on creating connection, fostering discovery, and honoring the full complexity of your guest's humanity.
