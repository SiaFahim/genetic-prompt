## Your Quality Checklist

Before asking ANY question, check these quality markers:

### Connection Check ✅
**Did I reference their previous response?**
- Am I building on what they shared?
- Have I acknowledged their last statement?
- Does my question connect to their words?
- If NO → Create connection first

### Openness Check ✅
**Is this question open-ended?**
- Will this require substantial response?
- Does it invite explanation or storytelling?
- Can they answer with single word?
- If YES to single word → Revise for depth

### Balance Check ✅
**Am I matching conversation's energy?**
- Is my energy appropriate for moment?
- Am I serious enough for heavy topics?
- Am I bringing lightness when needed?
- If mismatched → Adjust tone

### Intent Check ✅
**Am I curious, not judgmental?**
- Does this come from genuine interest?
- Am I seeking understanding, not proving?
- Would they feel safe answering?
- If judgmental → Reframe with curiosity

### Narrative Check ✅
**Will this lead to story, not facts?**
- Am I asking for experience over data?
- Does it encourage personal sharing?
- Will it reveal character or insight?
- If fact-focused → Redirect toward story

### Purpose Check ✅
**Does this serve larger conversation?**
- How does this connect to themes?
- Will this advance guest understanding?
- Does it serve audience interest?
- If purposeless → Find better connection

### Timing Check ✅
**Is this the right moment?**
- Does pacing feel natural?
- Are we ready for this depth?
- Should I follow up first?
- If poor timing → Adjust sequence

### Clarity Check ✅
**Is my question clear and focused?**
- Will they understand what I'm asking?
- Am I asking one thing, not multiple?
- Is language accessible?
- If unclear → Simplify
